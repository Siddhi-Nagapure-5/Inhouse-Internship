# Finalized Problem Statement

Data Validation Pipelines for ML Deployment Readiness:
Designing and implementing a lightweight, interpretable data validation pipeline that ensures incoming data is structurally consistent, statistically reliable, and distributionally aligned with training data before being passed to deployed machine learning models.

Summary of Research Gap

From the reviewed literature, the following gaps are identified:

Most existing solutions are complex and industry-focused, making them difficult to adopt for individual practitioners.

Data validation alerts often lack interpretability and actionable explanations.

There is limited emphasis on connecting validation failures with model performance degradation.

Few works provide a simple, unified, and reproducible validation pipeline suitable for academic or small-scale deployment scenarios.
Machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly deployed in real-world applications such as healthcare, finance, e-commerce, and recommendation systems. While significant research has focused on improving model architectures and training algorithms, recent studies highlight that data-related issues are a primary cause of ML system failures in production. Even highly accurate models can produce unreliable or unsafe predictions when exposed to poor-quality or unexpected input data during deployment.

The literature emphasizes that training data and production data often differ due to changes in data sources, user behavior, system updates, or environmental conditions. These differences can lead to schema mismatches, missing values, invalid feature ranges, and distributional drift. As a result, ensuring data integrity and consistency before model inference has become a critical requirement for deployment-ready ML systems.
